# Weather-Station

The weather station is my first attempt at building and implementing a programmable electronic system based on Raspberry Pi Pico WH and the BME280 temperature, humidity and pressure sensor. The code for RP Pico was created in microPython in the Thonny IDE. The scripts responsible for sending and receiving data from the MySQL database and displaying them were implemented in PHP in the Visual Studio Code (source-code editor).
